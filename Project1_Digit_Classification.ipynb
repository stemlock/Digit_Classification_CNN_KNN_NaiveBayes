It uses a dataset called \"fashion_mnist\", which is identical in structure to the original digit mnist, but uses images of clothing rather than images of digits. The number of training examples and number of labels is the same. In fact, you can simply replace the code that loads \"fashion_mnist\" with \"mnist\" and everything should work fine."

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes model does not improve the results of the accuracy score, and in fact reduces the accuracy score. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the Multinomial score is very similar to the Bernoulli score given that the majority of pixels have values at the extreme ends of the normalized scores (close to 0 or 1). This can be seen from the histogram above. As a result, creating a third class for grey between 0.1 and 0.9 does not account for very many of the pixels, and therefore should not affect the overall accuracy score very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed slight decrease in score is likely due to the fact that the Naive Bayes algorithm assumes that the features (in this case each pixel) are indepedent. Given this independence assumption, we assume that the probability of seeing a white pixel vs a grey pixel vs a black pixel is independent, even though these values will be dependent on the other pixels around them. Therefore, separating out a black pixel (0.1-1) in the binomial case into either a grey pixel (0.1-0.9) or black pixel (0.9-1) will lower the frequencies of each of these pixels occuring　(although very slightly). Thus, the multinomial model will have a more difficult time predicting the labels (or digits) for black given that it has less confidence to make the prediction."

    "The best value of alpha according to the GridSearch was the alpha value of 0.001, which return an accuracy score of 0.825. However, the range of prediction scores across the different values of alpha was relatively small, with only a 4% difference between the worst and best cases. When the alpha value was near 0, the prediction accuracy was 0.814, which is only slightly less than the best accuracy score. This small difference between the alpha values besides the huge variation in the value itself is expected given the fact that we have dense data given the MNIST data set. Specifically, each pixel takes on a value of 0 or 1, meaning we do not have any missing data. Therefore, the alpha smoothing that is added to the frequencies will have minimal effect as the counts will take into account every example within the training data set. Most likely, for much larger values of alpha we will likely see the test scores decrease."

    "The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm assumes each feature has a underlying Gaussian, or normal, distribution. Within our digit data set, it is clear that the data are not drawn from a Gaussian distribution (as can be seen in the histogram above). From the histogram, we see that across all features, most of the values are skewed towards 0, with another smaller mode near 1. Not only is this the general trend, but many features will have much smaller variances compared to others, such as the pixels on the borders compared to those in the middle that in one digit the value could have a value close to 1, while for another digit the same pixel value could be close to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian distribution will weight values that are farther away from the mean much smaller. Given that we can see that the original average mean for the features is ~0.13, values far away from this will not be as effective in the calculations of the frequency probabilities. In order to account for this, we can use the variance smoothing parameter to smooth the distribution and increase the weight of the values that are further away from the distribution mean. The variance smoothing parameter will effect the value of epsilon which is added to the sigma value. As a result, this will provide a more accurate prediction score given the improved weighting of values."
